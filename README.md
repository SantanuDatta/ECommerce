I have created an e-commerce platform using the Laravel framework. It has a number of features that make shopping easier and more convenient for customers. For example, there's a wishlist function so people can save items they're interested in for later, and there are several payment options available, including SSL Commerz for secure transactions.

I've also added the ability for each product to have multiple images, so customers can get a better look at what they're considering purchasing. Additionally, the site settings allow me to fully customize the look of the platform so it truly represents my brand.

I'm always trying to improve the platform and expand my knowledge by implementing new features. This project has been a great way for me to continue learning and developing my skills as a programmer.
